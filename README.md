Ship is my simple special Wordpress theme for special customer requirements on the crew management site.
My client needed to redesign the site and I created it from scratch based on a PSD template.
In progress of work I used to jquery plugins for the slider on the main page and Ajax for loading custom post types on vacancies page.
scss is used for the layout, the content is transmitted by the ACF pro plugin (text type fields, WP editor, checkboxes, file, etc.); 
feedback form (including sending as a csv file) is a custom, its code is in the functions.php file, ajax function in js/ajax.js
As part of an integrated approach, the WP Yoast SEO plugin was also used with caching and minification plugins.
Also since the client had no need to support older browsers, I used images with .webp resolution as recommended by Google

The pages are:
Home
For owner
For seamen
Vacancies
